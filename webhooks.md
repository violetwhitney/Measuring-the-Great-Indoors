# Sequence: Template as Template
## Sequence Summary:
This sequence of modules introduces Grasshopper as a tool-creating medium, merging concepts in HCI, spatial thinking, affordance theory to use Grasshopper as a medium for general computational design processes
## Why?
Thanks to the ecosystem of plugins, and Rhino/Grasshopperâ€™s integration with Python/C# and other programming languages, Rhino/Grasshopper is effectively an interface/prototyping platform for spatial design and computational experimentation. Thinking and understanding of Rhino/Grasshopper as a platform, rather than a modeling program, enables us to experiment with spatial computing in conjunction with other computational tools.
## Modules:
Smart Paintbrush: Geometry as Input, Basic logic, metrics: 
Levels of Abstraction: Clusters and Plugins
Dashboards and Representation: Custom Preview, Human UI
Other Inputs: OSC, APIs, Data
Final Project: Urban Tradeoffs

## Module Summary

[Webhooks](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) allows you to make or receive a web request with IFTTT. This means that we can get applications not already supported by IFTTT to talk to IFTTT. We will use Processing to create an HTTP request that will alert our webhook triggering an action in IFTTT. There will be three basic parts to linking IFTTT and Processing:
